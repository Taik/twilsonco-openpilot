# MapD
The OpenStreetMap-based speed logical by the [Move Fast team](https://github.com/move-fast), [dragonpilot team](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot), and additional improvements by [sunnypilot](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/sunnypilot).

The comma three uses regular SciPy. To have a better experience with `mapd`, please go to [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) to update and improve your area's data (i.e., Speed Limit, Stop Signs, Traffic Lights).

To use `mapd`, you consent to `mapd` uploading the traces. You may opt out of uploading traces at any time.
